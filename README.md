## SQL Basics

### What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data in database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and SQLite.

### Database Components

#### Tables
Tables are the fundamental storage units in a relational database, consisting of rows (records) and columns (fields). Each table represents a specific entity or concept in your data model.

#### Keys
- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each row in a table. Cannot be null and must be unique.
- **Foreign Key**: References the primary key of another table, establishing relationships between tables.
- **Composite Key**: A primary key consisting of multiple columns.
- **Candidate Key**: A column or combination of columns that could serve as a primary key.
- **Super Key**: Any combination of columns that uniquely identifies a row.

#### Data Types

**Numeric Types**:
- `INT` / `INTEGER`: Whole numbers
- `DECIMAL(p,s)` / `NUMERIC(p,s)`: Fixed-point numbers with precision
- `FLOAT` / `REAL`: Floating-point numbers
- `DOUBLE`: Double-precision floating-point

**String Types**:
- `CHAR(n)`: Fixed-length character string
- `VARCHAR(n)`: Variable-length character string
- `TEXT`: Large text data
- `NCHAR` / `NVARCHAR`: Unicode character strings

**Date/Time Types**:
- `DATE`: Date values (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `TIME`: Time values (HH:MM:SS)
- `DATETIME` / `TIMESTAMP`: Date and time combined
- `YEAR`: Year values

**Other Types**:
- `BOOLEAN` / `BIT`: True/false values
- `BLOB`: Binary large objects
- `JSON`: JSON data (modern databases)

## Database Fundamentals

### Database Design Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Keep designs straightforward and user-friendly
2. **Consistency**: Use standardized naming conventions
3. **Scalability**: Design for future growth and modifications
4. **Data Integrity**: Ensure accuracy and consistency of data
5. **Performance**: Optimize for efficient data retrieval and manipulation

### Best Practices for Database Design

#### Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only
- Use descriptive table and column names
- Pluralize table names (e.g., `customers`, `orders`)
- Avoid reserved keywords and special characters

#### Table Structure
- Every table should have an integer primary key
- Minimize redundant data
- Use appropriate data types for each column
- Consider foreign key relationships carefully

## Data Operations

### DDL (Data Definition Language)

DDL commands define and modify the structure of database objects.

#### CREATE
```sql
-- Create Database
CREATE DATABASE company_db;

-- Create Table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    hire_date DATE,
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id)
);
```

#### ALTER
```sql
-- Add Column
ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(15);

-- Modify Column
ALTER TABLE employees MODIFY COLUMN salary DECIMAL(12,2);

-- Drop Column
ALTER TABLE employees DROP COLUMN phone;
```

#### DROP
```sql
-- Drop Table
DROP TABLE employees;

-- Drop Database
DROP DATABASE company_db;
```

#### TRUNCATE
```sql
-- Remove all data but keep structure
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
```

### DML (Data Manipulation Language)

DML commands manipulate data within database tables.

#### INSERT
```sql
-- Insert single record
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, salary, department_id)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@company.com', '2023-01-15', 75000.00, 1);

-- Insert multiple records
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, salary, department_id)
VALUES 
    ('Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@company.com', '2023-02-01', 80000.00, 2),
    ('Mike', 'Johnson', 'mike.johnson@company.com', '2023-02-15', 70000.00, 1);
```

#### UPDATE
```sql
-- Update specific records
UPDATE employees 
SET salary = salary * 1.1 
WHERE department_id = 1;

-- Update with JOIN
UPDATE employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
SET e.salary = e.salary * 1.05
WHERE d.name = 'Engineering';
```

#### DELETE
```sql
-- Delete specific records
DELETE FROM employees WHERE hire_date < '2020-01-01';

-- Delete with subquery
DELETE FROM employees 
WHERE department_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name = 'Temporary'
);
```

### DCL (Data Control Language)

DCL commands control access to data and database objects.

#### GRANT
```sql
-- Grant permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON employees TO 'hr_user'@'localhost';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON company_db.* TO 'admin_user'@'localhost';
```

#### REVOKE
```sql
-- Revoke permissions
REVOKE INSERT ON employees FROM 'hr_user'@'localhost';
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON company_db.* FROM 'admin_user'@'localhost';
```

### TCL (Transaction Control Language)

TCL commands manage database transactions.

#### Transaction Control
```sql
-- Start transaction
START TRANSACTION;

-- Perform operations
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 1000 WHERE account_id = 2;

-- Commit changes
COMMIT;

-- Or rollback if needed
-- ROLLBACK;

-- Savepoint usage
SAVEPOINT before_update;
UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1;
-- If something goes wrong:
ROLLBACK TO before_update;
```

## Joins, Subqueries & Views

### SQL Joins

Joins combine data from multiple tables based on related columns.

#### INNER JOIN
Returns only records with matching values in both tables.
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.name as department
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

#### LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.name as department
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

#### RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.name as department
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

#### FULL OUTER JOIN
Returns all records when there's a match in either table.
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.name as department
FROM employees e
FULL OUTER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

#### CROSS JOIN
Returns the Cartesian product of both tables.
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, d.name
FROM employees e
CROSS JOIN departments d;
```

#### SELF JOIN
Joins a table with itself.
```sql
SELECT e1.first_name as employee, e2.first_name as manager
FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
```

### Subqueries

#### Scalar Subqueries
Return a single value.
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

#### Row Subqueries
Return a single row with multiple columns.
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE (department_id, salary) = (
    SELECT department_id, MAX(salary)
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
    LIMIT 1
);
```

#### Table Subqueries
Return multiple rows and columns.
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM departments 
    WHERE name IN ('Engineering', 'Sales')
);
```

#### Correlated Subqueries
Reference columns from the outer query.
```sql
SELECT e1.first_name, e1.last_name, e1.salary
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(e2.salary)
    FROM employees e2
    WHERE e2.department_id = e1.department_id
);
```

### Views

Views are virtual tables based on SQL queries.

#### Creating Views
```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_summary AS
SELECT 
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name,
    d.name as department,
    e.salary
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

#### Using Views
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee_summary
WHERE department = 'Engineering';
```

#### Updatable Views
```sql
-- Simple view that can be updated
CREATE VIEW high_salary_employees AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 75000;

-- Update through view
UPDATE high_salary_employees
SET salary = salary * 1.05
WHERE employee_id = 1;
```

---

## Indexes, Triggers & Procedures

### Indexes

Indexes improve query performance by creating efficient data retrieval paths.

#### Types of Indexes

**Clustered Index**: Determines physical storage order of data.
```sql
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_Employee_ID 
ON employees(employee_id);
```

**Non-Clustered Index**: Separate structure pointing to data rows.
```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Employee_Email 
ON employees(email);
```

**Composite Index**: Index on multiple columns.
```sql
CREATE INDEX IX_Employee_Dept_Salary 
ON employees(department_id, salary);
```

**Unique Index**: Ensures uniqueness and improves performance.
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IX_Employee_Email_Unique 
ON employees(email);
```

**Partial Index**: Index only rows meeting certain conditions.
```sql
CREATE INDEX IX_Active_Employees 
ON employees(last_name) 
WHERE status = 'ACTIVE';
```

#### Index Best Practices

1. **Filter First**: Place most selective columns first in composite indexes
2. **Sort Second**: Order columns by query sorting requirements
3. **Cover Queries**: Include all SELECT columns in covering indexes
4. **Monitor Usage**: Remove unused indexes to improve write performance

### Triggers

Triggers are special stored procedures that automatically execute in response to database events.

#### DML Triggers
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER audit_employee_changes
AFTER UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO employee_audit (
        employee_id, 
        old_salary, 
        new_salary, 
        changed_by, 
        changed_date
    )
    VALUES (
        NEW.employee_id,
        OLD.salary,
        NEW.salary,
        USER(),
        NOW()
    );
END;
```

#### DDL Triggers
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER prevent_table_drop
ON DATABASE
FOR DROP_TABLE
AS
BEGIN
    PRINT 'Table dropping is not allowed!'
    ROLLBACK;
END;
```

#### INSTEAD OF Triggers (for views)
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER employee_view_insert
INSTEAD OF INSERT ON employee_summary
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, department_id)
    VALUES (NEW.first_name, NEW.last_name, 
        (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name = NEW.department)
    );
END;
```

### Stored Procedures

Stored procedures are precompiled SQL code blocks stored in the database.

#### Basic Stored Procedure
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeesByDepartment(
    IN dept_name VARCHAR(50)
)
BEGIN
    SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.salary
    FROM employees e
    JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
    WHERE d.name = dept_name;
END;

-- Execute procedure
CALL GetEmployeesByDepartment('Engineering');
```

#### Procedure with Output Parameters
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeStats(
    IN dept_id INT,
    OUT total_employees INT,
    OUT avg_salary DECIMAL(10,2)
)
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(salary)
    INTO total_employees, avg_salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id = dept_id;
END;

-- Execute with output parameters
CALL GetEmployeeStats(1, @count, @avg);
SELECT @count, @avg;
```

#### Functions vs Procedures

**Functions**:
- Must return a value
- Can be used in SELECT statements
- Cannot modify data (generally)
- Cannot use transactions

**Procedures**:
- May or may not return values
- Cannot be used in SELECT statements
- Can modify data
- Can use transactions and error handling

## Aggregate Functions & Window Functions

### Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions perform calculations on sets of rows and return single values.

#### Basic Aggregate Functions
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_employees,
    COUNT(salary) as employees_with_salary,
    AVG(salary) as average_salary,
    SUM(salary) as total_payroll,
    MIN(salary) as lowest_salary,
    MAX(salary) as highest_salary,
    STDDEV(salary) as salary_std_dev
FROM employees;
```

#### GROUP BY with Aggregates
```sql
SELECT 
    d.name as department,
    COUNT(*) as employee_count,
    AVG(e.salary) as avg_salary,
    MIN(e.hire_date) as first_hire,
    MAX(e.hire_date) as latest_hire
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
GROUP BY d.id, d.name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

### Window Functions

Window functions perform calculations across related rows without grouping.

#### ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK
```sql
SELECT 
    first_name,
    last_name,
    salary,
    department_id,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) as row_num,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank_pos,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) as dense_rank_pos
FROM employees;
```

#### Aggregate Window Functions
```sql
SELECT 
    first_name,
    last_name,
    salary,
    department_id,
    SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) as dept_total_salary,
    AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) as dept_avg_salary,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) as dept_employee_count,
    salary - AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) as salary_diff_from_avg
FROM employees;
```

#### Frame Clauses
```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    hire_date,
    salary,
    -- Running total
    SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) as running_total,
    -- Moving average (last 3 employees)
    AVG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date ROWS 2 PRECEDING) as moving_avg_3,
    -- Difference from previous
    salary - LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) as salary_increase
FROM employees;
```

#### LEAD and LAG Functions
```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    hire_date,
    salary,
    LAG(salary, 1) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) as previous_salary,
    LEAD(salary, 1) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) as next_salary,
    salary - LAG(salary, 1) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) as salary_change
FROM employees;
```

#### FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE
```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    department_id,
    salary,
    FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) as highest_in_dept,
    LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC 
                             ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) as lowest_in_dept
FROM employees;
```

## Normalization & Denormalization

### Database Normalization

Normalization organizes data to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity.

#### First Normal Form (1NF)

**Requirements**:
- All columns contain atomic (indivisible) values
- Each row is unique
- No repeating groups

**Before 1NF**:
```
| ID | Name | Phone Numbers |
|----|------|---------------|
| 1  | John | 123-456, 789-012 |
| 2  | Jane | 345-678 |
```

**After 1NF**:
```
| ID | Name | Phone Number |
|----|------|-------------|
| 1  | John | 123-456     |
| 1  | John | 789-012     |
| 2  | Jane | 345-678     |
```

#### Second Normal Form (2NF)

**Requirements**:
- Must be in 1NF
- No partial dependencies (non-key attributes fully depend on primary key)

**Before 2NF**:
```
| StudentID | CourseID | StudentName | CourseName | Grade |
|-----------|----------|-------------|------------|-------|
| 1         | 101      | John        | Math       | A     |
| 1         | 102      | John        | Science    | B     |
```

**After 2NF**:
```
Students:
| StudentID | StudentName |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1         | John        |

Courses:
| CourseID | CourseName |
|----------|------------|
| 101      | Math       |
| 102      | Science    |

Enrollments:
| StudentID | CourseID | Grade |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1         | 101      | A     |
| 1         | 102      | B     |
```

#### Third Normal Form (3NF)

**Requirements**:
- Must be in 2NF
- No transitive dependencies (non-key attributes don't depend on other non-key attributes)

**Before 3NF**:
```
| EmployeeID | DepartmentID | DepartmentName | DepartmentHead |
|------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1          | 10           | Engineering    | Smith          |
| 2          | 10           | Engineering    | Smith          |
```

**After 3NF**:
```
Employees:
| EmployeeID | DepartmentID |
|------------|--------------|
| 1          | 10           |
| 2          | 10           |

Departments:
| DepartmentID | DepartmentName | DepartmentHead |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| 10           | Engineering    | Smith          |
```

#### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

**Requirements**:
- Must be in 3NF
- For every functional dependency X â†’ Y, X must be a superkey

BCNF is a stricter version of 3NF that handles cases where 3NF might still have anomalies.

### Denormalization

Denormalization intentionally introduces redundancy to improve query performance.

#### When to Denormalize
- Read-heavy applications
- Complex joins affecting performance
- Reporting and analytics requirements
- Data warehouse environments

#### Denormalization Techniques
```sql
-- Adding calculated columns
ALTER TABLE orders 
ADD COLUMN total_amount DECIMAL(10,2);

-- Maintaining redundant data
UPDATE orders o
SET total_amount = (
    SELECT SUM(quantity * unit_price)
    FROM order_items oi
    WHERE oi.order_id = o.order_id
);

-- Creating summary tables
CREATE TABLE monthly_sales_summary AS
SELECT 
    YEAR(order_date) as year,
    MONTH(order_date) as month,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_revenue,
    AVG(total_amount) as avg_order_value
FROM orders
GROUP BY YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date);
```

## Advanced Concepts & Security

### ACID Properties

ACID ensures database transactions are processed reliably.

#### Atomicity
All operations within a transaction succeed or fail together.
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
-- Either both succeed or both fail
COMMIT; -- or ROLLBACK;
```

#### Consistency
Database remains in a valid state before and after transactions.
```sql
-- Constraint ensures consistency
ALTER TABLE accounts 
ADD CONSTRAINT check_positive_balance 
CHECK (balance >= 0);
```

#### Isolation
Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other.
```sql
-- Set isolation level
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
-- or SERIALIZABLE, REPEATABLE READ, READ UNCOMMITTED
```

#### Durability
Committed changes persist even after system failure.
```sql
-- Database ensures durability through logging and backup mechanisms
COMMIT; -- Changes are permanently stored
```

### SQL Security

#### SQL Injection Prevention

**Vulnerable Code**:
```sql
-- DON'T DO THIS
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'";
```

**Secure Code with Parameterized Queries**:
```sql
-- Use parameterized queries
PREPARE stmt FROM 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?';
EXECUTE stmt USING @username, @password;
```

#### Authentication & Authorization

**User Management**:
```sql
-- Create user
CREATE USER 'app_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'strong_password';

-- Grant specific permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON company_db.orders TO 'app_user'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON company_db.customers TO 'app_user'@'localhost';

-- Create role
CREATE ROLE 'sales_role';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON sales_data.* TO 'sales_role';
GRANT 'sales_role' TO 'app_user'@'localhost';
```

#### Data Encryption

**Column-Level Encryption**:
```sql
-- Create encrypted column
CREATE TABLE sensitive_data (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    encrypted_ssn VARBINARY(255),
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Insert encrypted data
INSERT INTO sensitive_data (id, encrypted_ssn, name)
VALUES (1, AES_ENCRYPT('123-45-6789', 'encryption_key'), 'John Doe');

-- Decrypt data
SELECT id, AES_DECRYPT(encrypted_ssn, 'encryption_key') as ssn, name
FROM sensitive_data;
```

#### Row-Level Security

**Implementing RLS**:
```sql
-- Create security predicate function
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.SecurityPredicate(@UserId INT)
RETURNS TABLE
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
RETURN SELECT 1 AS AccessResult 
WHERE @UserId = USER_ID();

-- Apply security policy
CREATE SECURITY POLICY UserAccessPolicy
ADD FILTER PREDICATE dbo.SecurityPredicate(UserId) ON dbo.SensitiveTable;
```

#### Auditing

**Audit Trail Implementation**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    audit_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    table_name VARCHAR(50),
    operation VARCHAR(10),
    user_name VARCHAR(50),
    timestamp DATETIME,
    old_values JSON,
    new_values JSON
);

-- Audit trigger
CREATE TRIGGER audit_employees
AFTER UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audit_log (table_name, operation, user_name, timestamp, old_values, new_values)
    VALUES ('employees', 'UPDATE', USER(), NOW(), 
            JSON_OBJECT('salary', OLD.salary),
            JSON_OBJECT('salary', NEW.salary));
END;
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Query Optimization Techniques

**Use Indexes Effectively**:
```sql
-- Query that benefits from composite index
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE customer_id = 123 AND order_date >= '2023-01-01';

-- Create supporting index
CREATE INDEX IX_Orders_Customer_Date ON orders(customer_id, order_date);
```

**Avoid SELECT \***:
```sql
-- Instead of this
SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE condition;

-- Do this
SELECT id, name, email FROM large_table WHERE condition;
```

**Use EXISTS instead of IN for large subqueries**:
```sql
-- Better performance with EXISTS
SELECT * FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o 
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
);
```

#### Database Partitioning

**Range Partitioning**:
```sql
-- Partition table by date range
CREATE TABLE sales_data (
    id INT,
    sale_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2)
) 
PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(sale_date)) (
    PARTITION p2022 VALUES LESS THAN (2023),
    PARTITION p2023 VALUES LESS THAN (2024),
    PARTITION p2024 VALUES LESS THAN (2025)
);
```

## Top 100+ Interview Questions

### Basic SQL Questions (1-30)

**1. What is SQL and what does it stand for?**
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It's a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data efficiently across various database management systems.

**2. What are the different types of SQL commands?**
SQL commands are categorized into five types: DDL (Data Definition Language) for structure, DML (Data Manipulation Language) for data, DCL (Data Control Language) for permissions, TCL (Transaction Control Language) for transactions, and DQL (Data Query Language) for retrieval.

**3. Explain the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR data types.**
CHAR is fixed-length storing exact specified characters with padding, while VARCHAR is variable-length storing only actual characters used. CHAR offers consistent storage but wastes space; VARCHAR saves space but has slight performance overhead for variable lengths.

**4. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses?**
WHERE filters individual rows before grouping and cannot use aggregate functions, while HAVING filters groups after GROUP BY and can use aggregate functions. WHERE executes first, then GROUP BY, then HAVING.

**5. What are NULL values and how are they handled?**
NULL represents missing or unknown data, not zero or empty string. It cannot be compared with equals; use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL. Aggregate functions typically ignore NULLs, and any arithmetic operation with NULL returns NULL.

**6. What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?**
INNER JOIN returns only matching records from both tables, while LEFT JOIN returns all records from left table plus matching records from right table. Unmatched right table records appear as NULL in LEFT JOIN results.

**7. Explain the concept of primary key.**
Primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table, cannot contain NULL values, and must be unique. A table can have only one primary key, which can consist of single or multiple columns (composite key).

**8. What is a foreign key?**
Foreign key is a column referencing another table's primary key, establishing relationships between tables. It ensures referential integrity by preventing actions that destroy links between tables and maintains data consistency across related tables.

**9. What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE?**
DELETE removes specific rows using WHERE conditions, can be rolled back, and triggers fire. TRUNCATE removes all rows faster, cannot be rolled back (in some databases), resets identity columns, and doesn't fire triggers.

**10. What are aggregate functions? Give examples.**
Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple rows returning single values. Examples include COUNT (count rows), SUM (total values), AVG (average), MIN (minimum value), MAX (maximum value), and STDDEV (standard deviation) commonly used with GROUP BY.

**11. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?**
UNION removes duplicate rows from combined result sets and sorts results, while UNION ALL includes all rows including duplicates without sorting. UNION ALL is faster as it skips duplicate removal and sorting processes.

**12. Explain the GROUP BY clause.**
GROUP BY groups rows with same values in specified columns into summary rows, often used with aggregate functions. It divides result set into groups where each group represents unique combination of grouped column values.

**13. What is a subquery?**
Subquery is a query nested inside another query, also called inner query. It can return single value (scalar), single row, or multiple rows. Subqueries can be used in SELECT, WHERE, FROM, and HAVING clauses.

**14. What are the different types of subqueries?**
Subqueries include scalar (single value), row (single row multiple columns), table (multiple rows/columns), correlated (references outer query), and non-correlated (independent). They can also be classified as single-row, multiple-row, and multiple-column subqueries.

**15. What is the difference between IN and EXISTS?**
IN checks if value exists in subquery result list, while EXISTS checks if subquery returns any rows. EXISTS is generally faster for large datasets as it stops after finding first match, unlike IN.

**16. What are indexes and why are they important?**
Indexes are data structures that improve query performance by creating efficient access paths to table data. They speed up data retrieval but slow down INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations and consume additional storage space.

**17. What is the difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes?**
Clustered index determines physical storage order of table data; only one per table. Non-clustered index creates separate structure pointing to data rows; multiple allowed per table. Clustered affects storage; non-clustered doesn't change physical order.

**18. What is normalization?**
Normalization organizes database to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity by decomposing tables into smaller, related tables. It follows normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF) to eliminate data anomalies and ensure efficient storage.

**19. What are the different normal forms?**
Normal forms include 1NF (atomic values), 2NF (no partial dependencies), 3NF (no transitive dependencies), BCNF (stricter 3NF), 4NF (no multi-valued dependencies), and 5NF (no join dependencies). Each builds upon previous forms progressively.

**20. What is denormalization and when is it used?**
Denormalization intentionally introduces redundancy to improve query performance by reducing joins. Used in read-heavy applications, data warehouses, and reporting systems where query speed matters more than storage efficiency and update anomalies.

**21. What are constraints in SQL?**
Constraints enforce rules on table data ensuring accuracy and reliability. Types include NOT NULL (prevents null values), UNIQUE (prevents duplicates), PRIMARY KEY (unique identifier), FOREIGN KEY (referential integrity), CHECK (value conditions), and DEFAULT (default values).

**22. What is the difference between DROP and DELETE?**
DROP removes entire table structure and data permanently from database; cannot be rolled back. DELETE removes specific rows from table keeping structure intact; can use WHERE clause and can be rolled back in transactions.

**23. What are views and their advantages?**
Views are virtual tables based on query results that simplify complex queries, provide data security by limiting access, ensure data independence, and present data in different formats. They don't store data physically but dynamically generate results.

**24. What is the difference between stored procedures and functions?**
Stored procedures can have input/output parameters, modify data, use transactions, and can't be used in SELECT statements. Functions must return values, can only have input parameters, can't modify data, and can be used in queries.

**25. What are triggers?**
Triggers are special stored procedures automatically executed in response to database events like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE. Types include DML triggers (data changes), DDL triggers (structure changes), and logon triggers (user login events). Used for auditing and business rules.

**26. What is the difference between HAVING and WHERE with GROUP BY?**
WHERE filters rows before grouping and cannot use aggregate functions. HAVING filters groups after GROUP BY and can use aggregate functions. Execution order: WHERE â†’ GROUP BY â†’ HAVING â†’ SELECT â†’ ORDER BY.

**27. What are window functions?**
Window functions perform calculations across related rows without collapsing them into single row like aggregate functions. They use OVER clause with optional PARTITION BY and ORDER BY. Examples include ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, and aggregate window functions.

**28. What is the difference between RANK and DENSE_RANK?**
RANK assigns same rank to tied values but skips subsequent ranks (1,2,2,4), while DENSE_RANK assigns same rank without skipping (1,2,2,3). ROW_NUMBER assigns unique sequential numbers regardless of ties (1,2,3,4).

**29. What are CTEs (Common Table Expressions)?**
CTEs are temporary named result sets defined within query scope using WITH clause. They improve readability, enable recursive queries, and can be referenced multiple times within main query. Exist only during query execution.

**30. What is the difference between correlated and non-correlated subqueries?**
Correlated subqueries reference columns from outer query and execute for each outer row, making them slower. Non-correlated subqueries are independent, execute once, and their results are used by outer query, making them faster.

### Intermediate SQL Questions (31-60)

**31. How do you find the second highest salary from an employee table?**
Use subquery with MAX function excluding highest salary: SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees). Alternatively, use window functions with DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) and filter where dense_rank = 2.

**32. Write a query to find duplicate records in a table.**
SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1. This groups identical values and filters groups with more than one occurrence, effectively identifying duplicate records.

**33. How do you delete duplicate records keeping only one copy?**
Use window function to identify duplicates: DELETE FROM table WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT MIN(id) FROM table GROUP BY duplicate_column). Or use ROW_NUMBER() to mark duplicates and delete where row_number > 1.

**34. What is the difference between LIMIT and TOP?**
LIMIT is used in MySQL, PostgreSQL to restrict result rows: SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 10. TOP is used in SQL Server: SELECT TOP 10 * FROM table. Both achieve same result but syntax differs by database system.

**35. How do you handle NULL values in calculations?**
Use COALESCE, ISNULL, or CASE statements to handle NULLs: SELECT COALESCE(salary, 0) FROM employees. Any arithmetic operation with NULL returns NULL, so replace NULLs with appropriate values before calculations to avoid unexpected results.

**36. What are transaction isolation levels?**
Four isolation levels: READ UNCOMMITTED (allows dirty reads), READ COMMITTED (prevents dirty reads), REPEATABLE READ (prevents non-repeatable reads), SERIALIZABLE (prevents phantom reads). Higher levels provide more consistency but reduce concurrency and performance.

**37. Explain ACID properties with examples.**
Atomicity: All operations succeed or fail together. Consistency: Database rules are maintained. Isolation: Concurrent transactions don't interfere. Durability: Committed changes survive system failures. Example: Bank transfer must be atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.

**38. What is deadlock and how to prevent it?**
Deadlock occurs when two transactions wait for each other's resources indefinitely. Prevent by: accessing resources in same order, keeping transactions short, using appropriate isolation levels, implementing timeout mechanisms, and proper indexing strategies.

**39. What are materialized views?**
Materialized views are physical copies of query results stored on disk, unlike regular views. They improve performance for complex queries but require storage space and refresh mechanisms to maintain data currency. Used in data warehousing and reporting.

**40. How do you optimize a slow-running query?**
Analyze execution plan, add appropriate indexes, avoid SELECT *, use WHERE clauses effectively, consider query rewriting, check statistics currency, avoid functions in WHERE clauses, use proper joins instead of subqueries, and analyze table fragmentation.

**41. What is query execution plan?**
Query execution plan shows how database engine executes query, including table access methods, join algorithms, and cost estimates. Use EXPLAIN or similar commands to analyze plans and identify performance bottlenecks for optimization opportunities.

**42. What are different types of joins with examples?**
INNER JOIN (matching records), LEFT/RIGHT JOIN (all from one side), FULL OUTER JOIN (all from both), CROSS JOIN (cartesian product), SELF JOIN (table with itself). Each serves different data retrieval needs based on relationship requirements.

**43. What is the difference between EXISTS and IN when used with subqueries?**
EXISTS returns TRUE if subquery returns any rows, stops after first match. IN checks if value exists in subquery results, evaluates all results. EXISTS generally performs better with large datasets due to early termination.

**44. How do you find employees with salary greater than their department average?**
SELECT * FROM employees e1 WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees e2 WHERE e2.department_id = e1.department_id). This correlated subquery calculates department average for each employee and compares individual salary.

**45. What are recursive CTEs?**
Recursive CTEs reference themselves to process hierarchical data. Structure includes anchor member (base case) and recursive member (iterative case) connected by UNION ALL. Commonly used for organizational charts, bill of materials, and tree structures.

**46. How do you pivot data in SQL?**
Use CASE statements with aggregation: SELECT id, SUM(CASE WHEN category='A' THEN amount END) as A_total FROM table GROUP BY id. Modern databases support PIVOT operator for easier transformation of rows to columns.

**47. What is the difference between CASE and IF statements?**
CASE is ANSI standard, works across databases, handles multiple conditions elegantly. IF is database-specific (MySQL), simpler for binary conditions. CASE structure: CASE WHEN condition THEN result ELSE default END supports complex conditional logic.

**48. How do you handle date calculations in SQL?**
Use database-specific date functions: DATEADD, DATEDIFF (SQL Server), DATE_ADD, INTERVAL (MySQL), or standard EXTRACT function. Common operations include adding/subtracting dates, calculating differences, and extracting date parts like year, month, day.

**49. What are the different ways to join three or more tables?**
Multiple approaches: chain JOINs (A JOIN B ON... JOIN C ON...), use subqueries, or combine different join types. Order matters for performance; place most selective conditions first and use appropriate indexes.

**50. How do you find the nth highest salary?**
Use window functions: SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM (SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank FROM employees) WHERE rank = n. Alternative: use LIMIT with OFFSET or nested subqueries.

**51. What is the difference between CROSS JOIN and FULL OUTER JOIN?**
CROSS JOIN produces Cartesian product (every row from first table with every row from second). FULL OUTER JOIN returns all rows when there's match in either table, showing NULLs for non-matching sides.

**52. How do you handle string manipulations in SQL?**
Use string functions: CONCAT (joining), SUBSTRING (extracting parts), UPPER/LOWER (case conversion), TRIM (removing spaces), LENGTH (string length), REPLACE (substitution), and LIKE with wildcards for pattern matching in queries.

**53. What are user-defined functions?**
Custom functions created by users for specific business logic. Types include scalar functions (return single value), table-valued functions (return table), and inline functions. Provide code reusability and encapsulation of complex calculations.

**54. How do you implement pagination in SQL?**
Use LIMIT/OFFSET (MySQL, PostgreSQL): SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20. SQL Server uses OFFSET/FETCH: SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY id OFFSET 20 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY.

**55. What is the difference between temp tables and table variables?**
Temp tables (#temp) stored in tempdb, support indexes, statistics, can be referenced by other procedures. Table variables (@table) stored in memory/tempdb, limited scope, no statistics, faster for small datasets, transaction-independent.

**56. How do you merge data from two tables?**
Use MERGE statement (SQL Server): MERGE target USING source ON condition WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT. Alternative: use INSERT INTO...SELECT with ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE (MySQL).

**57. What are indexed views?**
Views with unique clustered index created on them, physically storing result data for better performance. Automatically maintained by database engine but have restrictions on query complexity and supported functions. Used for aggregated data optimization.

**58. How do you handle hierarchical data?**
Use adjacency list (parent_id), nested sets, or path enumeration models. Recursive CTEs help query hierarchical structures. Each model has trade-offs between query performance, update complexity, and storage requirements based on use case.

**59. What are synonyms in databases?**
Synonyms provide alternate names for database objects like tables, views, or procedures. They enable abstraction, simplify access to remote objects, and provide backward compatibility when objects are renamed or moved between schemas.

**60. How do you calculate running totals?**
Use window functions: SELECT id, amount, SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY id ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) as running_total FROM table. This calculates cumulative sum ordered by specified column, maintaining running balance throughout result set.

### Advanced SQL Questions (61-90)

**61. What are database partitions and their benefits?**
Partitions divide large tables into smaller manageable segments based on partition keys like date ranges. Benefits include improved query performance, easier maintenance, parallel processing capabilities, and reduced backup/restore times for specific data ranges.

**62. Explain different types of database locks.**
Lock types include shared locks (read operations), exclusive locks (write operations), update locks (intent to modify), schema locks (structure changes), and intent locks (hierarchical locking). Proper locking ensures data consistency while managing concurrency conflicts.

**63. What is row-level security?**
Row-level security restricts data access based on user characteristics by applying security predicates to table rows. Users see only authorized data without application changes. Implemented through security policies and predicate functions controlling row visibility.

**64. How do you implement audit trails?**
Create audit tables mirroring original structure plus metadata (user, timestamp, operation). Use triggers to automatically capture changes: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations. Include old/new values, user context, and change reasons for comprehensive tracking.

**65. What are database schemas and their purposes?**
Schemas are logical containers organizing database objects like tables, views, procedures. They provide namespace separation, security boundaries, ownership management, and logical grouping. Enable multi-tenant applications and organized database structure management efficiently.

**66. Explain database replication types.**
Master-slave replication (one-way), master-master (bi-directional), snapshot replication (periodic copies), transactional replication (real-time changes), and merge replication (conflict resolution). Each serves different availability, performance, and consistency requirements for distributed systems.

**67. What are computed columns?**
Computed columns derive values from expressions using other columns in same row. Can be virtual (calculated on-the-fly) or persisted (stored physically). Useful for calculations, concatenations, and business rules without application logic duplication.

**68. How do you handle very large tables?**
Strategies include partitioning, archiving old data, implementing pagination, using appropriate indexes, considering table compression, splitting into multiple tables, and using summarized/aggregated tables for reporting to maintain performance.

**69. What is database sharding?**
Sharding horizontally partitions data across multiple database servers based on shard keys. Each shard contains subset of total data. Improves scalability and performance but introduces complexity in queries, transactions, and data consistency management.

**70. Explain columnstore indexes.**
Columnstore indexes store data by columns rather than rows, providing excellent compression and performance for analytical queries. Ideal for data warehousing, reporting, and OLAP scenarios but less efficient for transactional operations.

**71. What are database statistics and their importance?**
Statistics contain information about data distribution, cardinality, and key densities used by query optimizer to choose execution plans. Outdated statistics lead to poor performance. Regular updates ensure optimal query execution plans.

**72. How do you implement soft deletes?**
Add boolean column (is_deleted, deleted_at) instead of physically removing records. Update queries to filter out deleted records. Maintains data integrity, enables data recovery, supports audit requirements, but requires application logic changes.

**73. What are database cursors?**
Cursors enable row-by-row processing of query results in procedural code. Types include forward-only, static, dynamic, and keyset cursors. Generally avoided due to performance impact; set-based operations preferred in modern database development.

**74. Explain temporal tables.**
Temporal tables automatically track historical data changes with system-versioned period columns. Database maintains current and history tables transparently. Enables point-in-time queries, data auditing, and compliance requirements without manual history management.

**75. What is change data capture (CDC)?**
CDC tracks and captures data changes (inserts, updates, deletes) in source tables, storing changes in change tables. Enables real-time data synchronization, ETL processes, and audit trails without impacting source system performance.

**76. How do you optimize database storage?**
Strategies include data compression, appropriate data types, archiving old data, removing unused indexes, normalizing where appropriate, using partitioning, and implementing data lifecycle management policies to minimize storage footprint.

**77. What are database check constraints?**
Check constraints enforce domain integrity by limiting values allowed in columns based on logical expressions. Examples: salary > 0, status IN ('Active', 'Inactive'). Ensure data validity at database level regardless of application logic.

**78. Explain database backup strategies.**
Strategies include full backups (complete database), differential backups (changes since last full), transaction log backups (continuous), and incremental backups. Recovery models determine backup options and point-in-time recovery capabilities.

**79. What is database mirroring?**
Database mirroring maintains two copies of database on separate server instances for high availability. Principal database serves clients while mirror stays synchronized. Provides automatic failover and disaster recovery capabilities.

**80. How do you handle concurrent updates?**
Use optimistic concurrency (timestamp/version columns), pessimistic concurrency (locks), or application-level conflict resolution. Choose strategy based on update frequency, conflict probability, and performance requirements for concurrent access scenarios.

**81. What are database roles and their management?**
Database roles group permissions for easier management. Built-in roles (db_owner, db_reader) and custom roles organize security. Users assigned to roles inherit permissions, simplifying security administration and maintenance in multi-user environments.

**82. Explain database connection pooling.**
Connection pooling maintains cache of database connections for reuse across multiple requests, reducing connection overhead. Improves application performance and resource utilization by avoiding costly connection establishment for each database operation.

**83. What are database triggers types and uses?**
DML triggers (AFTER/BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) for data changes, DDL triggers for schema changes, logon triggers for login events. Uses include auditing, business rule enforcement, automatic calculations, and maintaining derived data consistency.

**84. How do you implement database versioning?**
Track schema changes through migration scripts, version control systems, and deployment tools. Maintain change logs, use sequential versioning, implement rollback procedures, and automate deployment processes for consistent database evolution.

**85. What is database fragmentation?**
Fragmentation occurs when data pages are not optimally organized. Internal fragmentation (pages partially filled) and external fragmentation (logical order differs from physical). Impacts performance; resolved through index rebuilding and reorganization maintenance tasks.

**86. Explain database deadlock detection.**
Database systems monitor resource allocation graphs to detect circular wait conditions. When deadlock detected, system selects victim transaction to rollback, breaking deadlock cycle. Deadlock graphs and wait-for relationships help identify patterns.

**87. What are database hints and when to use them?**
Hints force query optimizer to use specific execution strategies like index selection, join methods, or lock types. Use sparingly when optimizer consistently chooses poor plans, but generally let optimizer make decisions for best performance.

**88. How do you implement database encryption?**
Implement transparent data encryption (TDE) for data-at-rest, Always Encrypted for client-side encryption, column-level encryption for specific sensitive data, and connection encryption for data-in-transit using SSL/TLS protocols.

**89. What are database sequences?**
Sequences generate unique numeric values automatically, often used for primary keys. Unlike identity columns, sequences are database objects shared across tables and can be incremented independent of INSERT operations. Provide better control than auto-increment.

**90. Explain database performance monitoring.**
Monitor key metrics: query execution times, resource utilization, blocking processes, index usage statistics, wait events, and error rates. Use database-specific tools, performance counters, and execution plans to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
